We are delighted ðŸ¥³ ðŸŽ‰ to announce that the "Rust and Tell" monthly meetup is kicking off again for 2021!
 
"Rust and Tellâ€œ is a monthly event to share ideas, and learn about new things in and about Rust. Meet fellow Rustaceans, share your learnings, get motivated and inspired.

Some ideas include but are not limited to: experience learning about async programming in Rust, how to implement a no-std compliant crate for use on embedded systems, or struggles with the borrow checker and how to overcome them. All ideas are welcome!

We are always looking for speakers of any level. Please either write in the comments below or message Evance Soumaoro, Ryan Levick, or Bastian Gruber on Meetup if you would like to speak. Unsure about your idea? No worries, talk to us anyway! We can help you refine and improve your talk!

We usually plan 3 slots of 20 minutes each. You decide on how you want to fill this time. We are also flexible in allocating longer time if you need it; just let us know so we can make the arrangement.

"Rust and Tellâ€œ is open to EVERYONE. From absolute beginner to experienced Rust programmers. We want to learn from your experience!
